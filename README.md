# The Maze

Given a Maze (a two-dimensional matrix) with a single arbitrary starting and
ending point, as well as an arbitrary number of wall blocks, display an actor's
route in the form of two-dimensional points from start to finish.

## Algorithm used

The algorithm used to solve the maze is the **Breadth First Search**

## Instructions

There are 3 example mazes (maze1, maze2, maze3) in order to demonstrate the maze solution, using the
Breadth First Search algorithm.

Once you clone the Repository, run the following:
`ruby themaze.rb`
You will be asked to enter the filename of the maze you want to solve. You can type either:
`maze1`, `maze2` or `maze3`

Of course you could also add your own maze file and give it's filename.

By pressing Enter, a preview of the Maze as well as the Solution Path (Route) will be print.
