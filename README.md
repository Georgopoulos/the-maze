# The Maze

Given a Maze (a two-dimensional matrix) with a single arbitrary starting and
ending point, as well as an arbitrary number of wall blocks, display an actor's
route in the form of two-dimensional points from start to finish.

## Algorithm used

The algorithm used to solve the maze is the **Breadth First Search**
